## 📌 Bio

An enthusiastic backend engineer with a strong foundation in scalable systems, I combine entrepreneurial experience as co-founder and CTO of the ongoing startup Silal with academic excellence as a Computer Engineering graduate with "High Distinction". Driven by a passion for learning, I’ve mastered various tools, frameworks, and technologies, earning certifications like CompTIA Linux+ and continually refining my skills through specialized courses.
Building Silal, completing numerous smaller projects, and developing a cloud-native AI solution for my graduation project, all demonstrated my ability to deliver innovative, production-ready solutions.
