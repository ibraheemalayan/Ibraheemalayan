## 📌 Bio

An enthusiastic back-end & cloud engineer with a strong foundation in scalable systems, I combine real-world technical and entrepreneurial experience as co-founder and an acting CTO of the ongoing startup Silal with academic excellence as a Computer Engineering graduate with High Distinction. Driven by a passion for learning, I’ve mastered various tools, frameworks, and technologies, earning certifications like Google Cloud Certified Associate Cloud Engineer and CompTIA Linux+ , while continually refining my skills through specialized courses.

Building Silal, completing numerous other projects, and developing a cloud-native AI solution for my capstone, all demonstrated my ability to deliver innovative, production-ready solutions. I love building cloud-native solutions on GCP and AWS , using tools like Kubernetes, Docker , and GitHub Actions to streamline CI/CD pipelines. I also enjoy crafting robust, scalable systems with backend frameworks like Django , Flask , and FastAPI — always keeping things efficient and fun!

P.S. I’m also decent at mobile and web development—so whether it’s backend, cloud, or mobile, consider me your friendly neighborhood developer ready to save the day. 😊
